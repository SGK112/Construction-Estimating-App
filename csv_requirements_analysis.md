# CSV-Connected App Requirements Analysis

## Overview

Based on the analysis of the provided code, the client needs a redesigned application that maintains and enhances the existing CSV-based pricing and product data integration. The current application is a React-based quoting tool for countertops that pulls data from Google Sheets CSV files, with features for filtering, searching, and building quotes.

## Core Requirements

### CSV Data Integration

1. **Multi-Vendor CSV Support**
   - Support for multiple vendor CSV sources via configurable URLs
   - Vendor-specific data mapping and normalization
   - Ability to switch between vendor data sources

2. **Real-Time Data Synchronization**
   - Automatic refresh of pricing data from CSV sources
   - Caching mechanism for offline use and performance
   - Timestamp-based validation for data freshness

3. **Data Normalization**
   - Consistent handling of color names, materials, and thicknesses
   - Standardized pricing calculations with regional multipliers
   - Waste factor calculations based on square footage

### User Interface

1. **Multi-Step Quote Process**
   - Search/filter step for finding products
   - Selection step for configuring quantities
   - Review step for finalizing and submitting quotes

2. **Advanced Filtering**
   - Filter by vendor, material, color, and thickness
   - Search functionality with highlighting
   - Type-ahead suggestions for search terms

3. **Responsive Design**
   - Mobile-friendly interface
   - Theme switching (light/dark mode)
   - Accessible UI components

### Business Logic

1. **Pricing Calculations**
   - Regional price adjustments based on ZIP code
   - Waste factor calculations based on project size
   - Support for special pricing rules and discounts

2. **Quote Management**
   - Local storage of quotes with encryption
   - Quote modification and item removal
   - Total cost calculations with detailed breakdowns

3. **Contact Information**
   - Form validation for customer details
   - Integration with backend systems for quote submission
   - Error handling for submission failures

## Technical Requirements

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Efficient CSV parsing with PapaParse
   - Debounced search and filtering
   - Local caching of processed data

2. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful degradation when CSV sources are unavailable
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Logging for debugging purposes

3. **Security**
   - Data sanitization for user inputs
   - Basic encryption for stored quotes
   - Protection against common web vulnerabilities

4. **Integration Points**
   - API endpoint for image retrieval based on color name
   - Potential for backend quote submission
   - Geolocation for regional pricing

## Data Structure

The CSV data appears to contain the following fields:
- Vendor Name
- Material Type
- Color Name
- Thickness
- Installed Price Per Square Foot
- Additional metadata (varies by vendor)

## Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Expanded CSV Integration**
   - Support for additional product types beyond countertops
   - Integration with labor cost CSV data
   - Dynamic addition of new vendors without code changes

2. **Advanced Visualization**
   - Color swatch generation from product images
   - Interactive layout designer for countertops
   - 3D visualization of selected materials

3. **Backend Integration**
   - Quote submission to CRM systems
   - Customer account management
   - Order tracking and status updates

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Modular Architecture**
   - Separate modules for CSV ingestion, data processing, and UI
   - Clear interfaces between components
   - Testable and maintainable code structure

2. **Scalability**
   - Support for growing number of vendors and products
   - Efficient handling of large CSV datasets
   - Performance optimization for mobile devices

3. **Maintainability**
   - Well-documented code and APIs
   - Consistent error handling patterns
   - Automated testing for critical paths

This analysis provides the foundation for designing a robust, scalable architecture for the CSV-connected application redesign.
